onMouse and onLoad

The MouseEvent interface represents events that occur due to the user interacting with a pointing device

The event occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element, or onto one of its children.

The onload event occurs when an object has been loaded. onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content
